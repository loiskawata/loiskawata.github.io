<p><i>"I had never heard of StoryWorth when Tara gave me a subscription to it as a birthday gift in August 2021. She explained that every Monday for one year I would receive an email from
StoryWorth with a question she had for me. I would write my answer, email it to StoryWorth and they would forward it to her and anyone else we wanted. At the end of the year, a book would be printed with all my answers and photos. I had often thought of writing a book about my life but it seemed overwhelming. And, would anyone be interested in reading my autobiography or memoir? What would I write about? Where would I begin and how would I organize it? What a daunting task! So StoryWorth sounded perfect. Tara would ask me questions about my life that she was interested in. Receiving a question on Monday and writing my answer made the project more manageable and feasible. I had about a week to write my answer so I couldn’t procrastinate. And, after a year I would be finished and a book would be printed. I loved it."</i></p>

<p><b>Lois' Testimonials about how Living with ALS brought her closer to God </b></p>
<p><i>"I wrote God, ALS, and Prayer in 2002. I've added an update at the end of it.  I think my experiences show that there is a higher power, which I call God, who can be involved in our daily lives. And, that we can have a personal relationship with Him. He continues to give me hope and helps me in so many amazing ways. This is the time for everyone in the world to know that God is real and ask for His help. I think many of us need a difficult situation in our lives to turn to God. For me it was ALS. What about you?"

One of my angels, Gary, created a link to a collection of my writings and named it "Musings, by Lois". Feel free to share the link below with others.</i></p>
